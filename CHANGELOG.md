## Latest Release: 0.9.1

* Removed getAttribute("resrc") from the getImgSrc() function. This was causing an error in Internet Explorer 8 and below.

## 0.9.0

* Removed redundant multiple calls to parseUri. 
* Added resrc.configure() as a public method. 
* resrc.configure() is a utility method for quick options setting.
* resrc.configure() can be chained as it returns the resrc object.
* Renamed resrc.resrc() to resrc.run(). Made sense for nicer readable code.
